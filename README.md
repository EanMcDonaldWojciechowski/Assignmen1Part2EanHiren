Part 2:
We decided to use an Array because of its similicity and versility.
We decided to allocate space in powers of two. So, when an Array is full,
we would double the space. If the half of the space is empty in an array,
we half the space. This allows our code to be the most efficient with speed
since we are not recreating space as often.
We included the all the methods stubs which will allow the Array to work.

Tests:
We have included all tests to make sure our code works.
We wanted to include tests to check when our code will break
such as including null pointers and out of bounds array index
values. However, our professor said to not include those tests
since those test would terminate our program.
